Your plans for Fellowship?
==========================

+ Recently submitted a paper comparing different methods of conducting discrete event simulation in terms of reproducibility of results.

+ Attend the annual conference of the Operational Research Society and discuss reproducibility of simulation results, propose a workshop on using Ciw
+ Attend the OR society's simulation workshop to discuss simulation software and reproducibility.

+ Use connections with the Coleg Cymraeg to make expand network and discuss sustainable software and reproducible computational results: this would involve speaking at Welsh language multi-disciplinary conferences organised by the coleg 
+ Continue to blog bilingually about research and software, and may involve writing blog posts in Welsh for the ssi
