Hi, my name is Geraint Palmer, I've recently started as a teaching associate at Cardiff University's School of Mathematics, making use of being bilingual. I am also completing the final bits my PhD.

My research interests are in stochastic modelling of queueing systems, and simulation techniques. In particular my PhD project has working with a local health board, applying these modelling techinques to patient flows in healthcare systems, in order to evaluate the effects of new community care interventions.

I use a wide variety of mathematical techniques including mathematical modelling, simulation, and data science. These all make heavy use of software. In my work I strive to follow best practices in research software. This includes the use of version control, test driven development, and well documented code. I have attended events put on by SSI, and currently work with two fellows who work in my research group.

A major part of my PhD work has been the development of an open-source discrete event simulation library in Python called Ciw, endeavouring to follow sustainable software development techniques throughout. The motivation behind this was to enable good computational research practices in the domain of stochastic simulation. I'll come back to this idea later on.

One of my main roles now is as a teaching associate at the School of Maths in Cardiff. My position is funded by a body called the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol, which I'll call the Coleg from now on. This is a national body in whose aim is to provide Welsh medium higher education in all subject areas in every Welsh university. They provide support for this in many areas:
  + Scholarships for undergraduates, PhD funding and postgraduate training
  + Fund and train staff like me to be able to provide Welsh medium education
  + Organise conferences for idea sharing across disciplines
My role at Cardiff is to accommodate this provision and deliver education through Welsh.
Promoting and using the Welsh language professionally is something I'm particularly passinate about.

This role involves supporting the teaching of programming in Python, and use of Latex. In addition this year I will be involved in delivering a 2 day research software development workshop for new PhD students, akin to a software carpentry workshop, in order to give new researchers a good grounding in sustainable software practices.

My role also involves outreach and work in the community. I tweet and blog bilingually about maths and software. I have been involved in local software focussed initiatives, for example I'm an organiser of PyDiff a Python meetup in Cardiff, I volunteered at DjangoCon Europe when it came to Cardiff, attended PyCon UK here and will attend again enxt month. I have also been involved in the Namibian Python community, as one of the organisers of Python conferences there, and delivering a workshop on Python for mathematics for UNAM staff.

I also have connections to operational research communities, I am a committee member of the South Wales OR discussion group, and organised a stream the the Young OR conference.

I'm looking forward to the collaborations workshop coming to Cardiff this year, and will be assisting with its organisation.

In my area, stochastic simulation, reproducibility of results is a known issue. This may be caused by lack of awareness of software techniques that foster reproducibility, and is mainly caused by the use of very popular commercial simulation packages. The use of these packages is encourages by teachers and textbooks. However they come with many drawbacks that can inhibit reproducibility:
  + Restrictive licences make model sharing difficult
  + Binary model files make version controlling models problematic
  + A preference for visuals and graphics obstructs model readability
Similar to the recent study on mistakes in genetic research being hidden by Excel, errors in simulation are easily hidden by GUIs.

I mentioned earlier that a large part of my PhD was the development of a library that allows simulation models to be readable, version controllable, shareable, and testable. I have recently submitted a paper to the Journal of Simulation discussing and comparing simulation frameworks in these terms.

I would like to use the fellowship to communicate and reinforce these ideas.

---

So my plan for the fellowship is twofold: The first thing would be to attend large operational research conferences, especially those with a focus on stochastic simulations to talk about these ideas. In particular, I would like to attend the annual conference of the British Operational Research society to talk about reproducibility in simulation modelling. I would also propose a workshop on using sustainable software techniques to make simulation models reproducible. The OR society also holds a biannual simulation workshop which I think would be an ideal opportunity to discuss these ideas with experienced simulation modellers, and I would like to attend and talk here too.

The second aspect of the fellowship would be to take advantage of my Welsh language connections. I would continue to blog bilingually about software and its use in maths, and my fellowship could involve writing Welsh languages blogs for the SSI. I believe my connections with the Coleg would expand my network across many fields, and ideas around best practices in software could reach new, Welsh medium, ears: and I would take advantage of the Coleg's multi-disciplinary conferences to talk about this. This would not only influence to people outside field, but spread the message in different language, reaching new communities of researchers.

To summarise, I would like to increase awareness of best software practices in two areas: stochastic simulation modelling in the operational research communities, and in the community of Welsh language academics.

Thank you for your time, and I hope you will consider me for the fellowship.
